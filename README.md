	3. Executive Summary
		The Election Audit Analysis model created in this module provides candidates, and the Election Commission, invaluable information for upcoming elections. Candidates can use this information to send their resources to the appropriate areas to most efficiently run their campaign. The Election Commission can use this data to ensure that their polling locations are appropriately staffed to prevent long lines in higher turnout areas while lower turnout areas are overstaffed. This model can be extrapolated and used for any set of entities that might be holding an election in the Commissions area of responsibility. The script can be modified for use in:
	⁃	City Council elections
	⁃	To determine which areas within a city have the highest voter turnout.
	⁃	Statewide elections
	⁃	To determine which areas within the state have the highest voter turnout.
